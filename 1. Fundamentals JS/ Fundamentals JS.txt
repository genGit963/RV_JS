1.  ------------------------ JavaScript Fundamentals ------------------------ 
    - Syntax and Operators
      - Understanding variable declarations: `var`, `let`, and `const`
      - Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
      - Comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `>`)
      - Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)

    - Data Types
      - Primitive types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, and symbol
      - Reference types: objects and arrays
      - Type coercion and type checking (`typeof`, `instanceof`)

    - Control Structures
      - Conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`
      - Loops: `for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...in`, `for...of`
      - Using `break` and `continue` for flow control

    - Functions
      - Function declarations vs. expressions
      - Arrow functions and their lexical `this` binding
      - Higher-order functions: functions that take other functions as arguments or return them
      - Callbacks and their role in asynchronous programming
      - Closures: functions that capture the scope in which they were created
      - IIFE

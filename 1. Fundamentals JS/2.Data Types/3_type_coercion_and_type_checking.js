Type Coercion

Type coercion in JavaScript refers to the automatic 
or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. 

JavaScript is loosely typed, meaning it doesnâ€™t require explicit 
type declarations, and it will often try to convert types in 
contexts like comparisons or arithmetic operations.

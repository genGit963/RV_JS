Promises:
    were introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), 
    which was released in June 2015. 
    
    They provided a way to handle asynchronous operations 
    and were a significant improvement 
    over earlier callback-based approaches.

Async/Await:
    was introduced later in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8), 
    which was finalized in June 2017. 
    
    This feature builds on Promises and allows 
    for writing asynchronous code 
    that looks and behaves more like synchronous code.

//        - Spread (`...`) and rest parameters (`...args`)

/**
 * spread operator (...) and the rest parameters (...args) 
        are two powerful features that enhance how you handle arrays 
        and function parameters. While they look similar, 
        they serve different purposes.

/**
 * Spread Operator (...)
        The spread operator allows you to expand elements of an 
        iterable (like an array or a string) 
        into individual elements. 
        It's useful for merging or cloning arrays and objects.
